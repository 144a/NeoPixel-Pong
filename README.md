# NeoPixel-Pong
A 1D Pong game where you control color of the paddle to match the incoming pixel's color

This uses the basic light ring control program I wrote to create a sort of "1D" pong. You change the color of the paddle to the same color of the "ball", as it runs around the ring. If, when the ball reaches the paddle, they are both the same color, then it will race back around in the other direction with a new color. It will slowly get faster, until you eventually lose, in which it will then play a gameover screen.

This is currently a work in progress, and only has the light moving animation completed.
